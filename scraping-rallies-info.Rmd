# Scraping( *rallies.info* Rally Results

The [*rallies.info()](https://www.rallies.info/) website provides a rally results service for a variety of club organised rally events in the UK.

The results are published via a simple HTML web page as well as via a PDF download.

In this chapter, we will review how we can "screenscrape" the results from a *rallies.info* web page into an *R* dataframe which we might then visualise using many of the same techniques we can use for visualisig WRC rally results data.
