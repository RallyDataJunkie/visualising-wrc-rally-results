# Accessing Data from the WRC Live Timing API

We can get rally details, timing and results data from the WRC live timing service JSON API.

## Current Season Rallies
To start with, let's see what rallies are scheduled for the current, active season. The `jsonlite::fromJSON()` will retrieve a JSON (*JavaScript Object Notation*) file from a URL and attempt to unpack it into an *R* dataframe:

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(jsonlite)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)

season_url = "https://api.wrc.com/contel-page/83388/calendar/active-season/"

get_active_season = function(active_season_url=season_url, all=FALSE) {
  if (all)
    jsonlite::fromJSON(active_season_url)
  else
    jsonlite::fromJSON(active_season_url)$rallyEvents$items
}

s = get_active_season()

# Preview the column names of the resulting dataframe
colnames(s)
```

Let's preview the contents of a couple of those columns:

```{r}
# The tidyr / magrittr pipe syntax makes things easier to read
s %>% select(c('id', 'name')) %>% head()
```

We can search the *name* column to find the unique identifier value for a particular event:

```{r}
eventId = s[s['name']=='WRC Arctic Rally Finland Powered by CapitalBox','id']

eventId
```

Or we can be more generic with a regular expression lookup:

```{r}
get_eventId_from_name = function(season, name){
  season[str_detect(season$name,
                    regex(name, ignore_case = T)), 'id']
}

get_eventId_from_name(s, 'arctic')
```

## Itinerary Lookup

We can make another call to the WRC API to look up the itinerary for the event. Each leg of the event corresponds to a particular day:

```{r}
results_api = 'https://api.wrc.com/results-api'

get_itinerary = function(eventId) {
  jsonlite::fromJSON(paste0(results_api,"/rally-event/",
                            eventId, "/itinerary"))$itineraryLegs
}

itinerary = get_itinerary(eventId)

itinerary %>% select(-itinerarySections)
```

The *itinerarySections* columns dataframes describing details of each leg.

### Leg Sections

Within each leg, the itinerary provides information about each section (that is, each "loop") of the rally. This information is retrieved in form of a dataframe in a standard format. We can use the base *R* `do.call()` to call the `rbind()` function against each row of the dataframe and bind all the dataframes in a specified column into a single dataframe:

```{r}
get_sections = function(itinerary){
  sections = do.call(rbind, itinerary$itinerarySections)
  sections
}

sections = get_sections(itinerary)

sections %>% select(-c(controls, stages))
```

In the sections dataframe we have one row per section. Two of the columns, `*controls* and *stages* each use dataframes to "nest" subdataframes within each row.

For example, here's one of the *controls* dataframes that describes timing controls:

```{r}
sections$controls[[1]]
```

And an example of a dataframe from the first row of the *stages* column:

```{r}
sections$stages[[1]]
```

### Time Controls

We can look up information about each time control from data provided as part of the itinerary lookup using the same trick as before to "unroll" the contents of each dataframe in a specified column into a single dataframe.

An alternative to the `do.call()` approach is to use a tidy approach and use the `dplyr::bind_rows()` function on the `sections$controls` column values via a pipe. We can add a reference to the original section ID by naming each row in the *controls* column with the *itinerarySectionId* value and then ensuring an identifier column is defined when we bind the dataframes:

```{r}
get_controls = function(sections){
  # Name each row in the list of dataframes we want to bind
  names(sections$controls) = sections$itinerarySectionId
  
  controls = sections$controls %>%
    # Ensure that we create an identifier column (uses list names)
    bind_rows(.id='itinerarySectionId')
  
  controls
}

controls = get_controls(sections)

controls %>% head(2)
```

### Stage Details

We can pull stage details from the dataframes contained in the `sections` dataframe from the itinerary lookup:

```{r}
get_stages = function(sections){
  # Name each row in the list of dataframes we want to bind
  names(sections$stages) = sections$itinerarySectionId
  
  stages = sections$stages %>%
    # Ensure that we create an identifier column (uses list names)
    bind_rows(.id='itinerarySectionId')
    
  stages
}

stages = get_stages(sections)

stages %>% head()
```

We can get a list of stage IDs from the `stageId` column (`stages$stageId`):

```{r}
get_stage_list = function(stages){
  stage_list = stages$stageId
  stage_list
}

get_stage_list(stages)
```

Perhaps more conveniently, we can create a lookup from code to stage ID:

```{r}
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/19265431/454773
get_stages_lookup = function(stages,
                             fromCol='code',  toCol='stageId'){
  stages_lookup = stages[[toCol]]
  names(stages_lookup) = stages[[fromCol]]
  stages_lookup
}

stages_lookup = get_stages_lookup(stages)
stages_lookup
# Lookup particular stage ID by stage code
#stages_lookup[['SS2']]
```

From the `stages` table, we can get the identifier for a particular stage, either by code (for example, *"SS3"*) or by (partial) name match:

```{r}
ssnum = 'SS3'

get_stage_id = function(stages, sname, typ='code'){
  # code, name
  if (typ=='code')
    stageId = stages[stages[typ] == sname, 'stageId']
  else
    stageId = stages[stringr::str_detect(stages[[typ]], sname), 'stageId']
  stageId
}

stageId = get_stage_id(stages, 'Mustalampi 1', 'name')
stageId
```

And the stage distance and name:

```{r}
get_stage_info = function(stages, sid, typ='stageId', clean=TRUE){
  # stageId, code
  name=stages[stages[typ] == sid, 'name']
  distance=stages[stages[typ] == sid, 'distance']
  if (clean)
    stringr::str_replace(name, ' (Live TV)', '')
  
  c(name=name, distance=distance)
}

get_stage_info(stages, stageId)
```

### Road Order Start Lists

The *startListId* can be used alongside the event ID to look up the startlist for a leg. We can order the startlist by start order:

```{r}
get_startlist = function(eventId, startListId) {
  startlist_url = paste0(results_api, '/rally-event/',
                         eventId,'/start-list-external/', startListId)
  
  startlist = jsonlite::fromJSON(startlist_url)$startListItems
  
  # Order the startlist dataframe by start order
  startlist %>% arrange(order)
}

# Example startlist ID
# Use a regular expression to find the startlist ID by day
startListId = itinerary[str_detect(itinerary$name,
                                   regex('Friday', ignore_case = T)),
                       'startListId']

startlist = get_startlist(eventId, startListId)

startlist %>% head()
```

Looking up a startlist ID is a little fiddly:

```{r}
get_startlist_id = function(itinerary, itinerarySectionId){
  sections = get_sections(itinerary)
  itineraryLegId = sections[sections$itinerarySectionId==itinerarySectionId,
                            'itineraryLegId']
  itinerary[itinerary$itineraryLegId==itineraryLegId,'startListId']
}

get_startlist_id(itinerary, stages$itinerarySectionId[[1]])
```

## Competitor Details

Details of car entries for each event can be retrieved from the WRC live timing API given an event ID.

```{r}
get_rally_entries = function(eventId) {
  cars_url = paste0(results_api, '/rally-event/',
                  eventId,'/cars')
  jsonlite::fromJSON(cars_url)
}

entries = get_rally_entries(eventId)
# $driver, $codriver, $manufacturer, $entrant, $group, $eventClasses
# $identifier, $vehicleModel, $eligibility, $status

entries %>% head(2)
```

### Looking Up Entries by Group

We can index the entries by group to find all the WRC car `entryId` values:

```{r}
entries[entries$group$name=='WRC', 'entryId']
```

### Driver & Codriver Details

Detailed information for each driver and codriver can be found in the corresponding sub-dataframes.

For example, we can look up the details for each driver, noting in this case that we need to column bind (`cbind()`) the subdataframes to produce the collated dataframe of driver details:

```{r}
get_drivers = function(entries){
  drivers = do.call(cbind, entries$driver)
  drivers
}

drivers = get_drivers(entries)

drivers %>% head(2)
```

We can similarly obtain data for the codrivers:

```{r}
#codrivers = do.call(cbind, entries$codriver)
# Again, there is a tidyverse approach with dplyr::bind_cols()
get_codrivers = function(entries){
  codrivers = bind_cols(entries$codriver)
  codrivers
}

codrivers = get_codrivers(entries)

codrivers %>% head(2)
```

We can conveniently obtain the identifier for a particular driver or codriver by searching against their name or three letter code, although note that *the three letter code may not be a unique identifier*:

```{r}
get_person_id = function(persons, sname, typ='fullName'){
  # code, fullName
  if (typ=='code')
    personsId = persons[persons[typ]==sname, 'personId']
  else
    personId = persons[str_detect(persons[[typ]],
                                           regex(sname,
                                                 ignore_case = T)),
                       'personId']
  personId
}

ogierDriverId = get_person_id(drivers, 'ogier')
ogierDriverId
```

From the driver person identifier we can get the entry identifier for the rally we're exploring:

```{r}
ogierEntryId  = entries[entries['driverId']==ogierDriverId, 'entryId']
ogierEntryId
```

### Summarising Essential Entry Data

We can manually create a dataframe containing essential fields from the original cars dataframe and the dataframes contained within it:

```{r}
get_car_data = function(entries){
  cols = c('entryId', 'driverId', 'codriverId','manufacturerId',
           'vehicleModel','eligibility', 'classname','manufacturer',
           'entrantname', 'groupname', 'drivername', 'code',
           'driverfullname', 'codrivername','codriverfullname'
           )
  entries = entries %>%
                        rowwise() %>% 
                        mutate(classname = eventClasses$name) %>%
                        mutate(manufacturer = manufacturer$name) %>%
                        mutate(entrantname = entrant$name) %>%
                        mutate(groupname = group$name) %>%
                        mutate(drivername = driver$abbvName) %>%
                        mutate(driverfullname = driver$fullName) %>%
                        mutate(codrivername = codriver$abbvName) %>%
                        mutate(codriverfullname = codriver$fullName) %>%
                        mutate(code = driver$code) %>%
                        select(all_of(cols))
  
  # If we don't cast, it's a non-rankable rowwise df
  as.data.frame(entries)
}

get_car_data(entries) %>% head(2)
```

## Penalties and Retirements

We can look up *penalties* from an event ID:

```{r}
get_penalties = function(eventId) {
  penalties_url = paste0(results_api, '/rally-event/',
                       eventId, '/penalties')
  jsonlite::fromJSON(penalties_url)
}

get_penalties(eventId) %>% head(2)
```

The event ID is also all we need to request a list of *retirements*:

```{r}
get_retirements = function(eventId) {
  retirements_url = paste0(results_api, '/rally-event/',
                       eventId, '/retirements')
  jsonlite::fromJSON(retirements_url)
}

get_retirements(eventId) %>% head(2)
```

## Results and Stage Winner

As well as retrieving penalties and retirements using just the event ID as a key, we can also retrieve the overall results and the stage winners:

```{r}
get_result = function(eventId) {
  result_url = paste0(results_api, '/rally-event/',
                    eventId,'/result')
  
  jsonlite::fromJSON(result_url)
}

get_result(eventId) %>% head(2)
```

And for the stage winners:

```{r}
get_stage_winners = function(eventId) {
  stage_winners_url = paste0(results_api, '/rally-event/',
                             eventId,'/stage-winners')
  
  jsonlite::fromJSON(stage_winners_url)
}

get_stage_winners(eventId) %>% head(2)
```

## Stage Result

At the end of each stage, there are actually two different sorts of results data are available: data relating to the result of the stage itself, and data relating to how the stage result affected the overall rally position.

Let's start by getting the overall rally result at the end of a particular stage. Note that the overall result does not include the stage ID in the returned data so we need to add it in:

```{r}
get_overall_result = function(eventId, stageId) {
  overall_url = paste0(results_api, '/rally-event/',
                           eventId, '/stage-result/stage-external/',
                           stageId)
  jsonlite::fromJSON(overall_url) %>%
    # Also add in the stage ID
    mutate(stageId = stageId)
}

overall_result = get_overall_result(eventId, stageId)

overall_result %>% head(2)
```

### Getting Stage Results for Multiple Stages

It will be convenient to be able to retrieve overall results for multiple stages from one function call. One way of achieving that is to create a function to retrieve the details for a single specified stage that can be applied via a `purrr::map()` function call to a list of the stage IDs we want overall results data for: 

```{r}
library(purrr)

get_overall_result2 = function(stageId, eventId) {
  get_overall_result(eventId, stageId)
}

get_multi_overall = function(stage_list){
  multi_overall = stage_list %>%
    map(get_overall_result2, eventId=eventId) %>% 
    bind_rows()
  multi_overall
}

# Specify the stage IDs for multiple stages
stage_list = c(1747,	1743)

multi_overall_results = get_multi_overall(stage_list)
  
multi_overall_results %>% tail(2)
```

## Stage Times

We can get the stage times for each stage on a rally by event and stage ID:

```{r}
get_stage_times = function(eventId, stageId) {
  stage_times_url = paste0(results_api, '/rally-event/',
                           eventId, '/stage-times/stage-external/',
                           stageId)
  jsonlite::fromJSON(stage_times_url)
}

stage_times = get_stage_times(eventId, stageId)

stage_times %>% head(2)
```

### Getting Stage Times for Multiple Stages

It will also be convenient to be able to retrieve stage times for multiple stages from a single function call. We can take the same approach we used previously:

```{r message=F, warning=F}
get_stage_times2 = function(stageId, eventId) {
                              get_stage_times(eventId, stageId)
                            }

get_multi_stage_times = function(stage_list){
  multi_stage_times = stage_list %>%
                      map(get_stage_times2, eventId=eventId) %>% 
                      bind_rows()
  multi_stage_times
}

multi_stage_times = get_multi_stage_times(stage_list)
  
multi_stage_times %>% tail(2)
```

### Getting Wide Stage Times for Multiple Stages

We can then widen the stage times for each driver:

```{r}
get_multi_stage_times_wide = function(multi_stage_times, stage_list){
  stage_times_cols = c('entryId', 'stageId', 'elapsedDurationMs')
  
  multi_stage_times_wide = multi_stage_times %>% 
                    select(all_of(stage_times_cols)) %>%
                    mutate(elapsedDurationS = elapsedDurationMs / 1000) %>%
                    select(-elapsedDurationMs) %>%
                    group_by(entryId) %>%
                    tidyr::spread(key = stageId,
                                  value = elapsedDurationS) %>%
                    select(c('entryId', as.character(stage_list))) %>%
                    # If we don't cast, it's a
                    # non-rankable rowwise df
                    as.data.frame()
  
  multi_stage_times_wide
}

multi_stage_times_wide = get_multi_stage_times_wide(multi_stage_times,
                                                    stage_list)

multi_stage_times_wide %>% head(2)
```

### Getting Wide Stage Positions

We can also get the stage positions:

```{r}
get_multi_stage_positions_wide = function(multi_stage_times, stage_list){
  stage_positions_cols = c('entryId', 'stageId', 'position')

  multi_stage_positions_wide = multi_stage_times %>% 
                    select(all_of(stage_positions_cols)) %>%
                    group_by(entryId) %>%
                    tidyr::spread(key = stageId,
                                  value = position) %>%
                    select(c('entryId', as.character(stage_list))) %>%
                    # If we don't cast, it's a
                    # non-rankable rowwise df
                    as.data.frame()
}

multi_stage_positions_wide = get_multi_stage_positions_wide(multi_stage_times, stage_list)

multi_stage_positions_wide %>% head(2)
```

### Getting Generic Wide Dataframes

We can start to work up a function that is able to handle widening data frames more generally, albeit with a potential need to handle exceptions:

```{r}
get_multi_stage_generic_wide = function(multi_stage_generic, stage_list,
                                        wide_val, group_key='entryId',
                                        spread_key='stageId'){
  
  stage_times_cols = c(group_key, spread_key, wide_val )
  
  if (wide_val=='elapsedDurationMs') {
    multi_stage_times_wide = multi_stage_times %>% 
      select(all_of(stage_times_cols)) %>%
      mutate(elapsedDurationS = elapsedDurationMs / 1000) %>%
      select(-elapsedDurationMs)
    
    wide_val = 'elapsedDurationS'
  }
  
  multi_stage_generic_wide = multi_stage_generic %>% 
    select(all_of(stage_times_cols)) %>%
    # group_by_at lets us pass in the grouping column by variable
    group_by_at(group_key) %>%
    tidyr::spread(key = spread_key,
                  value = wide_val) %>%
    select( c(group_key, as.character(stage_list))) %>%
    # If we don't cast, it's a
    # non-rankable rowwise df
    as.data.frame()
  
  multi_stage_generic_wide
}

multi_stage_positions_wide_g = get_multi_stage_generic_wide(multi_stage_times, stage_list, 'position')

multi_stage_positions_wide_g %>% head(2)
```

## Split Times

We can get split times and distance into stage data for each stage given the stage identifier:

```{r}
get_splits = function(eventId, stageId){
  splits_url=paste0(results_api, '/rally-event/', eventId,
                    '/split-times/stage-external/', stageId)

    jsonlite::fromJSON(splits_url)
}

splits = get_splits(eventId, stageId)
# $splitPoints
# $entrySplitPointTimes
```

This includes handy information about split locations, such as distance into stage. This can also be useful for pace calculations:

```{r}
splits$splitPoints
```

We can also view the split point times for each driver. This second dataframe contains rows summarising the stage for each driver, and includes the stage start time and duration as well as a column *splitPointTimes* that itself contains a data frame of elapsed duration split point times:

```{r}
splits$entrySplitPointTimes %>% select(-splitPointTimes) %>% head(2)
```

To view the split times for a specific driver, we can index into the dataframe using the driver `entryId` value:

```{r}
splits$entrySplitPointTimes[splits$entrySplitPointTimes['entryId']==ogierEntryId,]$splitPointTimes
```

Each dataframe gives the split times on the stage for a particular driver in a long format.

Note that the split point times are strictly increasing and describe the elapsed time into the stage at each split point from the start location and time.

### Driver Split Times Detail

We can get an unrolled long structure by combining the *splitPointTimes*  dataframes from all drivers, also taking the opportunity to convert the elapsed duration in milliseconds to seconds along the way:

```{r}
#driver_splits = do.call(rbind, entry_splits$splitPointTimes)
# The tidyverse approach is to use dplyr::bind_rows()
# We can also construct a pipe to streamline the processing
get_driver_splits = function(splits){
  driver_splits = splits$entrySplitPointTimes$splitPointTimes %>%
                    bind_rows() %>%
                    mutate(elapsedDurationS = elapsedDurationMs / 1000) %>%
                    select(-elapsedDurationMs)
  driver_splits
}

driver_splits = get_driver_splits(splits)

driver_splits %>% head(2)
```

### Wide Driver Split Times

We can cast the data into a wide format, with splits ordered by their distance into the stage. Start by creating a function to help get the split point codes in order by distance along the stage:

```{r}
get_split_cols = function(splits){
  split_cols =  as.character(arrange(splits$splitPoints, distance)$splitPointId)
  split_cols
}
```

Now create a function to get the driver splits in a wide format using the distance-into-stage ordered split point codes as the widened columns:

```{r}
get_driver_splits_wide = function(driver_splits, splits){
    split_cols =  get_split_cols(splits)
    splits_cols = c('entryId', 'splitPointId', 'elapsedDurationS')
    
    driver_splits_wide = driver_splits %>% 
                            group_by(entryId) %>%
                            select(all_of(splits_cols)) %>%
                            tidyr::spread(key = splitPointId,
                                          value = elapsedDurationS) %>%
                            select(all_of(c('entryId', split_cols))) %>%
                            # If we don't cast, it's a
                            # non-rankable rowwise df
                            as.data.frame()
    driver_splits_wide
}

driver_splits_wide =  get_driver_splits_wide(driver_splits, splits)

driver_splits_wide %>% head(2)

### Multiple Stage Long Splits Data

A convenient way of working with the split times across multiple stages is to put the splits into a long form and then filter out the rows we are interested in.

We can generate a long form dataframe using the `dlplyr::bind_rows()` that we have met before:

```{r}
get_split_times2 = function(stageId, eventId) {
                              splits = get_splits(eventId, stageId)
                              split_times = splits$entrySplitPointTimes
                              names(split_times$splitPointTimes) = splits$splitPoints$splitPointId
                              split_times$splitPointTimes
                            }

get_multi_split_times = function(stage_list){
  multi_split_times = stage_list %>%
                      map(get_split_times2, eventId=eventId) %>% 
                      bind_rows()
  multi_split_times
}

stage_list_sample = stage_list[1:2]

get_multi_split_times(stage_list[1:2]) %>% head(3)
```
